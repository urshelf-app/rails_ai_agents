# Rails AI Agents

A production-ready Claude Code setup for Ruby on Rails development: **19 specialized agents**, **29 slash commands** (including the [SDD kit](#spec-driven-development-sdd-kit)), **22 skills**, **15 rules** (11 path-scoped + 4 always-on), **1 MCP**, and **8 lifecycle hooks**. Drop it into your project and your AI assistant instantly knows Rails conventions, TDD workflows, and production patterns.

Also includes:
- [Spec Driven Development (SDD) kit](#spec-driven-development-sdd-kit) — a full specification-to-implementation pipeline + lightweight mode for bug fixes.
- Claude Code Extensibility Guide
- and more!


## Latest Updates

- Wire in graphify: knowledge-graph search replaces grep as the default way to explore code
- Add caveman rule with full intensity level (token reduction)
- Add plan, review, and PR artifact commands.
- Add tmux session launcher script for Rails development.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Copy the .claude/ directory into your Rails project
cp -r .claude/ /path/to/your-rails-app/.claude/
```

| If you want... | Copy |
|---|---|
| Default setup (layered architecture, RSpec, Pundit, PostgreSQL) | `.claude/` |
| Spec Driven Development commands (`/sdd:*`, `/sdd-change:*`) | `.specify/` in addition to `.claude/` |
| Statusline | `statusline/` |
| Sentry integration | `mcp/sentry_monitor/` |
| Knowledge-graph search instead of grep | `graphify install --project --strict` (see [Knowledge Graph](#knowledge-graph-graphify)) |

`.specify/` is optional unless you want the SDD workflow. The slash-command set documented below lives under `.claude/commands/`.

## OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot Support

This repo includes a practical setup for both OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot (including different Copilot-backed models such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini), while keeping `.claude/` as the canonical source.

- `AGENTS.md` is the shared high-level project instruction file.
- `.agents/skills/` is the mirrored skills directory used by Codex and reusable from Copilot.
- `.claude/skills/` remains the canonical source for shared skills.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is the Copilot entrypoint.
- `.github/instructions/claude-rules/` contains generated path-scoped bridge files that point back to `.claude/rules/`.

Because Codex skill discovery is currently unreliable with symlinks, this repo includes a local sync script that copies Claude skills into real directories:

```bash
scripts/sync_claude_skills_to_codex.sh
scripts/sync_claude_rules_to_copilot.sh
```

Run these scripts after adding, removing, or renaming any skill or rule. If Codex or Copilot is already running, restart or reload the chat session to pick up updates.

### Rules (`.claude/rules/`)

15 rules: 11 path-scoped (auto-load when Claude works on matching files) and 4 always-on.

#### Path-scoped (11)

| Rule | Scoped to |
|---|---|
| `models.md` | `app/models/**`, `spec/models/**`, `spec/factories/**` |
| `controllers.md` | `app/controllers/**`, `spec/requests/**` |
| `services.md` | `app/services/**`, `spec/services/**` |
| `queries.md` | `app/queries/**`, `spec/queries/**` |
| `policies.md` | `app/policies/**`, `spec/policies/**` |
| `jobs.md` | `app/jobs/**`, `spec/jobs/**` |
| `mailers.md` | `app/mailers/**`, `spec/mailers/**` |
| `migrations.md` | `db/migrate/**`, `db/schema.rb` |
| `views.md` | `app/views/**`, `app/components/**`, `app/presenters/**` |
| `testing.md` | `spec/**` |
| `anti-patterns.md` | `app/**/*.rb`, `spec/**/*.rb` |

#### Always-on (4)

| Rule | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `principles.md` | KISS, DRY, YAGNI, SRP, Rails architecture principles, and the pre-write ladder (reuse → Rails/Ruby → platform → installed gem → minimum code) |
| `cli.md` | Rails CLI commands reference (dev server, tests, db, generators) |
| `cli-tools.md` | Preferred CLI tools: `rg` over `grep`, `fd` over `find` |
| `caveman.md` | Terse response style for token reduction — keeps all technical substance, drops filler |

### Hooks (`.claude/settings.json`)

| Hook | Event | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **SessionStart** | Session begins | Injects project context (branch, Ruby/Rails version, pending migrations) |
| **PostToolUse** | After Edit/Write | Auto-formats Ruby files with RuboCop and ERB files with erblint |
| **PreToolUse** | Before Bash | Blocks destructive commands (rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force push to main) |
| **PreToolUse** | Before Bash/Grep | `graphify hook-guard search` — steers text searches toward the knowledge graph |
| **PreToolUse** | Before Read/Glob | `graphify hook-guard read --strict` — blocks the first raw file read of a session until one `graphify query` has run |
| **TaskCompleted** | Task marked done | Quality gate: reminds to run tests and linting |
| **Stop** | Response ends | Desktop notification |

### Settings

- **Agent Teams** enabled (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`)
- **JSON Schema** for editor autocomplete
- **Smart model routing**: opus for architecture/security, sonnet for coding, haiku for linting
- **Pre-approved graph queries**: read-only `graphify` subcommands (`query`, `path`, `explain`, `affected`, `god-nodes`, `update`, ...) are allowlisted in `permissions.allow`, so graph lookups never interrupt you with a prompt. Commands that cost money or change your setup (`extract`, `label`, `install`, `global`, `export --push`) are deliberately left out and still ask.

### Knowledge Graph (`graphify`)

The pack is wired to **query a knowledge graph before grepping or reading source**. `graphify`
indexes the codebase into `graphify-out/graph.json` — symbols, cross-file relationships, community
structure, and architectural hubs — and answers codebase questions with a scoped subgraph instead
of a pile of grep hits.

**Prerequisite:** the `graphify` binary must be on `PATH` ([graphify.com](https://app.graphify.com)).
Without it the hooks fail open and the pack falls back to `rg` / `fd`.

Setup in a new project:

```bash
graphify install --project --strict   # skill + CLAUDE.md section + PreToolUse hooks, project-scoped
/graphify .                           # build the initial graph
```

Daily use:

```bash
graphify query "how does checkout apply discounts"   # start here, not with grep
graphify path "Order" "PaymentGateway"               # how two things relate
graphify explain "Entities::CreateService"           # focused explanation of one symbol
graphify affected "User#email"                       # blast radius of a change
graphify update .                                    # after editing code (AST-only, no API cost)
```

What enforces it:

| Layer | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` graphify section | Written by `graphify install`; tells the assistant to query the graph first |
| `.claude/rules/cli-tools.md` | Graph commands are the documented default; `rg` / `fd` are demoted to an explicit fallback for non-code text search |
| PreToolUse hooks | `hook-guard search` steers Bash/Grep searches to the graph; `hook-guard read --strict` blocks the first raw file read of a session until one `graphify query` runs |
| `permissions.allow` | Read-only graph commands run without a permission prompt |

Strict mode is the `--strict` flag on the install. Turn it off per session with
`GRAPHIFY_HOOK_STRICT=0` without touching the config. `graphify-out/` is gitignored — each clone
rebuilds its own graph.

#### MCP mode (optional, advanced — not wired into this pack)

Graphify can also expose the graph over a stdio MCP server. It is deliberately **not** registered in
`.claude/settings.json`, because it does not survive being copied between projects. Wire it up
per project, in that project's own `.mcp.json`, only if you want it.

```bash
# the graph must already be built
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify.serve graphify-out/graph.json
```

Tools exposed: `query_graph`, `get_node`, `get_neighbors`, `get_community`, `god_nodes`,
`graph_stats`, `shortest_path`.

**Read this before enabling it:**

- **Absolute paths only.** Both the interpreter (`cat graphify-out/.graphify_python`) and the
  `graph.json` argument must be absolute — a `$(...)` substitution is not evaluated by MCP clients.
  That is why this cannot ship in a pack meant to be copied into other repos.
- **The graph must exist first.** The server points at a concrete `graph.json` and fails to start
  without one. The CLI path degrades quietly instead: with no graph, `hook-guard` exits 0 and the
  pack falls back to `rg` / `fd`.
- **Subagents will not see it.** All 19 agents declare a closed `tools:` allowlist containing
  `Bash`, which is what lets them run the CLI today. MCP tools would have to be added to all 19
  frontmatters by hand.
- **Strict mode interaction is untested.** `hook-guard` watches the Bash/Grep/Read/Glob tools, not
  the MCP namespace. An MCP call may not clear the first-read gate, in which case file reads stay
  blocked until a `graphify query` runs through Bash anyway.
- **`affected` has no MCP equivalent.** Blast-radius analysis — arguably the most useful command
  during a refactor — is CLI-only, as are `update`, `save-result`, and `reflect`. What MCP adds
  over the CLI is `get_neighbors`, `get_community`, and `graph_stats`.

Worth it for a single long-lived project where neighborhood and community exploration is routine.
Not worth it for a portable configuration pack.

### Statusline (`statusline/`)

A two-line statusline that surfaces the signals you actually need while working: git state, model, and usage budgets.

![Statusline](statusline/screenshot.png)

- **Line 1** — current branch (with a `✗` marker when the working tree is dirty), model name, and reasoning effort level
- **Line 2** — context window usage, 5-hour rate-limit usage with reset countdown, 7-day rate-limit usage with reset countdown
- **Color-coded thresholds** — green under 50%, yellow 50–79%, red at 80%+ so you can see budget pressure at a glance

Wire it up in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "bash /absolute/path/to/statusline/statusline.sh"
  }
}
```

## Spec Driven Development (SDD) Kit

A structured specification-to-implementation pipeline powered by 11 slash commands. SDD enforces a disciplined workflow: define what you're building before writing code, validate requirements quality, then implement from a task plan.

### SDD Commands (`.claude/commands/sdd/`)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/sdd:constitution` | Create or update the project constitution — core principles and governance rules |
| `/sdd:specify` | Generate a feature specification from a natural language description |
| `/sdd:clarify` | Ask up to 5 targeted questions to reduce ambiguity in the spec |
| `/sdd:spec-review` | Adversarial review of the spec from security, performance, edge-case, scalability, and compliance perspectives |
| `/sdd:checklist` | Generate a requirements quality checklist |
| `/sdd:plan` | Create a technical implementation plan with research, data model, and contracts |
| `/sdd:tasks` | Break the plan into dependency-ordered, executable tasks organized by user story |
| `/sdd:analyze` | Read-only consistency analysis across spec, plan, and tasks |
| `/sdd:implement` | Execute the task plan phase-by-phase with progress tracking |
| `/sdd:implement-subagents` | Same as implement, but spawns a fresh-context subagent per task to prevent context rot on large features |
| `/sdd:validate` | Post-implementation drift detection — verifies code implements what the spec promises (4-layer hybrid, no annotations needed) |

### SDD Workflow

```
/sdd:constitution                  # 1. Define project principles (once)
/sdd:specify user authentication   # 2. Write the feature spec
/sdd:clarify                       # 3. Resolve ambiguities (optional)
/sdd:spec-review                   # 4. Adversarial review from 5 perspectives (optional)
/sdd:checklist security            # 5. Validate requirements quality (optional)
/sdd:plan                          # 6. Generate technical plan + data model
/sdd:tasks                         # 7. Break into ordered tasks
/sdd:analyze                       # 8. Cross-artifact consistency check
/sdd:implement                     # 9. Execute tasks with verification
# Or for large features:
/sdd:implement-subagents           # 9. Fresh-context subagent per task (prevents context rot)
/sdd:validate                      # 10. Verify implementation matches spec (post-implementation)
```

Each command hands off to the next via suggested prompts. The pipeline creates a `specs/<branch-name>/` directory with all artifacts:

```
specs/001-user-auth/
├── spec.md           # Feature specification (/sdd:specify)
├── plan.md           # Implementation plan (/sdd:plan)
├── research.md       # Technical research & decisions (/sdd:plan)
├── data-model.md     # Entity definitions (/sdd:plan)
├── quickstart.md     # Integration scenarios (/sdd:plan)
├── contracts/        # Route and API contracts (/sdd:plan)
├── tasks.md          # Executable task list (/sdd:tasks)
├── checklists/       # Requirements quality checklists (/sdd:checklist)
└── validation-report.md  # Post-implementation drift report (/sdd:validate)
```

### SDD Infrastructure (`.specify/`)

The `.specify/` directory contains the scaffolding that powers SDD commands. It is optional for normal prompting; you only need it for the `/sdd:*` and `/sdd-change:*` workflows:

- **`templates/`** — Markdown templates for specs, plans, tasks, checklists, constitutions, and agent context files
- **`scripts/bash/`** — Shell scripts for branch creation, prerequisite checking, plan setup, and agent context updates
- **`memory/`** — Persistent project state (constitution, lessons learned across features)
- **`init-options.json`** — Configuration (branch numbering mode, AI agent type)

SDD supports extensibility via `.specify/extensions.yml` for before/after hooks on any command, template overrides in `.specify/templates/overrides/`, and presets in `.specify/presets/`.

### Key SDD Concepts

- **Constitution** — Non-negotiable project principles validated at every planning gate
- **Lessons Learned** — Cross-feature learnings accumulate in `.specify/memory/lessons-learned.md` and feed into future planning and implementation
- **Adversarial Spec Review** — `/sdd:spec-review` challenges the spec from security, performance, edge-case, scalability, and compliance perspectives before planning begins
- **Specs are stakeholder-facing** — No implementation details; focus on WHAT and WHY
- **Checklists are "unit tests for English"** — They validate requirements quality, not implementation correctness
- **Tasks organized by user story** — Each story is independently implementable and testable (MVP-first)
- **Fresh-context implementation** — `/sdd:implement-subagents` spawns a clean subagent per task, preventing context rot on large features
- **Post-implementation validation** — `/sdd:validate` uses a 4-layer hybrid approach (structural scan, test mapping, AI semantic analysis, acceptance test generation) to verify the code matches the spec — works on day one, no code annotations needed

### SDD Small-Change (Lightweight Mode)

For bug fixes and small features that don't need the full SDD ceremony. Three commands, no plan, no checklists, no analysis — just specify, task, implement.

#### Commands (`.claude/commands/sdd-change/`)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/sdd-change:specify` | Create a minimal change spec (problem, fix, acceptance criteria, files affected) |
| `/sdd-change:tasks` | Generate a flat 3-8 task list from the change spec |
| `/sdd-change:implement` | Execute tasks sequentially with validation |

#### Workflow

```
/sdd-change:specify Fix login timeout — sessions expire after 5min instead of 30
/sdd-change:tasks
/sdd-change:implement
```

#### When to Use Which

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Bug fix, patch, tweak | `/sdd-change:specify` |
| New feature, multi-story epic | `/sdd:specify` |
| Refactor touching 1-3 files | `/sdd-change:specify` |
| Refactor touching 6+ files | `/sdd:specify` |

The lightweight pipeline warns you if your change looks too complex (>3 acceptance criteria or >6 files affected) and suggests switching to the full pipeline.

## Scripts (`scripts/`)

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `start_rails_tmux.sh` | Open (or reuse) a tmux session with a three-pane main-vertical layout: editor on the left, `bin/dev` (or `bin/rails server`) top-right, `bin/rails console` bottom-right. Idempotent — re-running attaches to the existing session and auto-restarts any pane that has dropped back to a shell prompt. |
| `sync_claude_skills_to_codex.sh` | Mirror `.claude/skills/` into `.agents/skills/` for OpenAI Codex compatibility |
| `sync_claude_rules_to_copilot.sh` | Generate `.github/instructions/claude-rules/` bridge files from `.claude/rules/` for GitHub Copilot |

## MCP Servers (`mcp/`)

Custom MCP servers that extend Claude Code with external integrations.

| Server | Purpose | Docs |
|--------|---------|------|
| [`sentry_monitor`](mcp/sentry_monitor/) | Exposes Sentry production errors as Claude Code tools — query issues, map stack traces to local files, detect new errors with persistent state tracking, PII redaction by default | [README](mcp/sentry_monitor/README.md) |
